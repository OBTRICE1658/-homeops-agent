🆘 NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT OVERRIDE - RENDER IS BROKEN 🆘
Timestamp: 2025-07-11T16:00:00Z
Version: EMERGENCY-OVERRIDE-v5.0
Status: RENDER WEBHOOK FAILURE DETECTED

� PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Render is stuck on old commit: "FIX: Width constraints for calendar and header" (12:02 PM)
This commit is from BEFORE the Google Calendar AI features were added.

🔧 SOLUTION REQUIRED:
1. MANUAL RENDER DEPLOYMENT ONLY
2. Go to https://dashboard.render.com 
3. Find homeops-agent service
4. Click "Manual Deploy"
5. FORCE deploy latest commit (ignore auto-deploy)

📊 WHAT'S MISSING FROM LIVE SITE:
❌ No blue "Sync Google Calendar" button
❌ No AI reframing system  
❌ No Google Calendar integration
❌ No calendar intelligence features
❌ Still showing old asset versions (v=2024-*)

✅ WHAT'S READY IN REPOSITORY:
✅ 356+ lines of Google Calendar AI code
✅ Complete integration with OAuth2 enhancement
✅ AI reframing with Mel Robbins + Malcolm Gladwell
✅ Smart event analysis for all event types
✅ Cache busting with v=2025-07-11

💡 ROOT CAUSE: Render's auto-deploy webhook is broken/cached
💡 ONLY SOLUTION: Manual deployment bypass
