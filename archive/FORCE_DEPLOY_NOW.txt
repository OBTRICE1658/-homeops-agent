Timestamp: 2025-07-11T15:45:00Z

GOOGLE CALENDAR AI FEATURES ARE READY BUT NOT DEPLOYING

The issue: Render is stuck on old "width constraints" commit
The solution: Manual deployment required

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com RIGHT NOW
2. Find homeops-agent service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" 
4. Deploy latest commit
5. This should override the stuck auto-deploy

ALL GOOGLE CALENDAR AI INTELLIGENCE FEATURES ARE CODED AND WAITING:
- Blue sync button
- AI reframing system  
- Calendar integration
- Smart actions
- Pattern analysis

This file exists solely to trigger a new commit and force Render to recognize the changes.
