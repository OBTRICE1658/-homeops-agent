## ðŸ›  Implementation Strategy

### **Week 1: Hybrid Approach (Current)**
```javascript
// Use seed brands + selective API enhancement
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Add 2-3 dynamic brands to each category
  const dynamicBrands = await this.dtcDiscovery.discoverBrandsByCategory(category);
  brandsInCategory = [...seedBrands, ...dynamicBrands.slice(0, 3)];
}
```

### **Week 2-4: Full API Integration**
- Replace seed database with live discovery
- Cache results for 24 hours to reduce API costs
- Build brand scoring algorithm with multiple signals
