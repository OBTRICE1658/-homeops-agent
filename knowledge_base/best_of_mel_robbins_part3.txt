Dr. Palmer's waitlist is three years long to be able to get in to see him, and this is like having a private appointment. In short, Dr. Palmer says that mental health issues like anxiety and depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, they happen when your brain's energy system, which is your metabolism, isn't working right. Just like your heart can have problems if you eat badly, Your brain can have issues, too. I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it? Of course it does. And the good news? Dr. Palmer says that you can use modifications to your diet, to your exercise routine, to your lifestyle to significantly improve your mental health. What does that mean? Well, it means the exact same things that help your heart and other organs in your body help you fix the problems in your brain, too, which will help you improve your brain's energy and improve your overall mental health. And that brings me to one of your most favorite moments of the entire year, the one that you shared more than just about anything else with friends and family that you watched over and over on YouTube. And that is Dr. Palmer's specific protocol for treating someone who is dealing with any mental health issue or any mental illness.
